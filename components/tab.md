# Tab

The Tab component is super simple to configure by just surrounding a block of text with `|||` and including a text value for the tab.

```md
||| Tab 1
This is a Tab
|||
```

||| Tab 1
This is a Tab
|||

## Multiple tabs

Multiple Tabs can be configured by stacking `|||` blocks.

```md
||| Tab 1
This is a Tab
||| Tab 2
This is another Tab
||| Tab 3
Wow! Yet another tab :+1:
|||
```

||| Tab 1
This is a Tab
||| Tab 2
This is another Tab
||| Tab 3
Wow! Yet another tab :+1:
