# Reference link

A special type of reference link can be configured by using the `!ref` specifier in a link.

```md Reference link component
[!ref Getting Started](../guides/getting_started.md)
```

[!ref Getting Started](../guides/getting_started.md)

Clicking anywhere within the reference link component will navigate to that new page.

From a functionality perspective, there is no difference betwen a `!ref` component and a regular hyperlink. The difference between the two is just how they are presented, with a Reference link component being more prominent than a regular hyperlink.
