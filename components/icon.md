# Icon

Similar to the [Emoji](emoji.md) `:shortcode:` syntax, you can add icons using `:icon-shortcode:`, where the `shortcode` is an [Octicon](https://primer.github.io/octicons/) icon name.

For example, to add the [`star`](https://primer.github.io/octicons/star-24) icon, use the `:icon-star:` icon shortcode. :icon-star:

Icons can be added anywhere within your document, including paragraph text, headings, table content, [Panel](panel.md) component titles, [Alerts](alert.md), [code block](code-block.md) titles, etc. :icon-thumbsup:

Some icon shortcode names are made up of `two-or-more` words. For instance, the [`git-branch`](https://primer.github.io/octicons/git-branch-24) icon would be configured as `:icon-git-branch:`. :icon-git-branch:

!!! More icons :icon-heart:
In future releases of Retype, the plan is to support additional Icon packs and possibily even custom developer defined icon packs. [Let us know](https://github.com/retypeapp/retype/discussions) if you are interested!
