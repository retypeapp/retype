# Project configuration

Retype will read the `retype.json` file for additional instructions on how to configure and build your project.

The `retype.json` file is typically stored in the root of your project, although can be placed elsewhere. Please ensure the `input` and `output` paths are correct if moved to a different location.

!!!
After making a change to the `retype.json`, if you are running `retype watch`, Retype will automatically rebuild the project for you and your web browser will refresh with the changes.

If you started the local web server using `retype run`, you'll need to call `retype build` to regenerate a :sparkles: sparkly :sparkles: fresh new build of the project, then manually refresh your web browser to see update.
!!!

The `retype.json` file is actually optional (not required), but is recommended as you will almost certainly want to customize some options, so adding a `retype.json` is a good first step.

Running the command `retype init` will create a default `retype.json` file. The following sample demonstrates a common set of configuration options and everything can be customized to your requirements.

```json Sample retype.json
{
  "input": ".",
  "output": ".retype",

  "branding": {
    "title": "Project Name",
    "label": "Docs"
  },

  "links": [
    {
      "text": "Getting Started",
      "link": "https://retype.com/getting_started/"
    }
  ],

  "footer": {
    "copyright": "© Copyright {{ year }}. All rights reserved."
  }
}
```

## base

+++ base : `string`

Base subfolder path appended to all URL's. Default is `null` or empty string.

If you deploy the build website to a subfolder of another website, use the `base` to ensure the URL's correclty resolve.

For instance, let's say your main site is `https://example.com` and will remain unchanged.  If you would like to deploy the Retype built website into a `/docs` subfolder, with the final URL of `https://example.com/docs`, then setting `"base": "docs"` would be required.

```json Sample: Change output location to /docs folder
{
  "base": "docs"
}
```

Another common scenario for setting a `base` is when using GitHub Pages **without** a custom `CANME`.

For instance, if your GitHub organization was `CompanyX` and your repo was named `my-repo`, the URL to your GitHub Pages hosted website would be:

```
https://companyx.github.io/my-repo/
```

The Retype generated wesite would require `"base": "my-repo"` to be set within your projects `retype.json` file in order to properly resolve the URL paths during build.

The `retype.json` file for that scenario would be...

```json retype.json
{
  "base": "my-repo"
}
```

...and the GitHub Pages configuration within your repo Settings would be:

## exclude

+++ exclude : `array`
Retype can exclude files or folders from being built by configuring an `exclude` string array within your projects `retype.json` file.

Exclude patterns are similar to allowable patterns within a `.gitignore` file. Wildcards `*` are allowed.

The following sample demonstrates how to exclude an entire `draft/` folder, any folder that ends with `*_temp/`, and one specific `/src/temp.md` file.

```json Exclude patterns
{
  "exclude": [
    "draft/",
    "*_temp/",
    "/src/temp.md"

If a custom `port` is explicitly configured in the `retype.json`, and if that port is already being used by another service, Retype will write a message to the console and exit. In that scenario, because the `port` was explicitly configured, Retype will not attempt to auto-increment.
