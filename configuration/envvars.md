# Environment variables

## RETYPE_SECRET

A Retype license key can be configured as a secret Environment variable and the key is NOT stored in the [wallet](/guides/cli.md#retype-wallet).

Configuring the `RETYPE_SECRET` secret is the prefered technique for configuring a license key with a GitHub Pages project that is built and deployed using a [GitHub Action](/guides/github-actions.md).

The [RETYPE_SECRET](../guides/github-actions.md#retype_secret) configuration must also be added to your **.github/workflows/retype.yml** file.

You can add a new repository secret to your GitHub repository using the following `/settings/secrets/actions` pattern. Replace the following `<your-organization>` and `<your-project>` with your repository values:

```
https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-project>/settings/secrets/actions
```

You should now see the **Respository secrets** section with a green button to add a **New repository secret**, similar to the following:

Click the **New repository secret** button to add a new secret, which should look similar to the following:

![](/static/add-retype-secret.png)

Once the `RETYPE_SECRET` secret is added, you should see the following and your Retype project will now build using your license key:

See [configuring](../guides/github-actions.md/#retype_secret) a GitHub Workflow to use your Retype license key.

## RETYPE_PASSWORD

Set an environment variable for the [`protected`](page.md/#protected) and [`private`](page.md/#private) pages. The `RETYPE_PASSWORD` value is set using exactly the same process as the [`RETYPE_SECRET`](#retype_secret) above. 

If you add both the `RETYPE_PASSWORD` and `RETYPE_SECRET`, your list of **Repository secrets** should look like the following:

![](/static/retype-repository-secrets-list-2.png)

## RETYPE_DEFAULT_HOST

Default [`host`](project.md/#host) to be used by the Retype server instead of `localhost`.

The `RETYPE_DEFAULT_HOST` secret is set exactly the same as above.
