# Page configuration

Individual `.md` pages can be configured using the [metadata](/faq.md#what-is-page-metadata) section added to the top of the page.

```md sample.md
---
label: Sample
layout: page
order: 100
---
# Sample page

This is a sample page demonstrating page metadata.
```

## Separate `.yml` file

If you would prefer to keep the page metadata separated and placed outside of the `.md` content page, the options can be moved into a paired `.yml` file.

For instance, `sample.md` would need a matching `sample.yml` file. The separate `.yml` file must have the exact same filename as its paired `.md` page.

Both `.yml` and `.yaml` extensions are supported.

Adding your configs into the top metadata section of a `.md` page, or into a separate `.yml` file is just a matter of preference. Both techniques produce the same result.

```md sample.md
# Sample page

This is a sample page demonstrating page metadata.
```

```yml sample.yml
label: Sample
layout: page
order: 100
```

!!!
If you add configs to both locations, the page [metadata](/faq.md#what-is-page-metadata) take precedence, even if they are different configs.

If you add one or more configs to a `.md` page, Retype will not look for nor read the separate `.yml` file. Just use one or the other, but not both.
!!!

See [folder configuration](folder.md) for details on how to configure a folder.

---

## author

!!!

The configuration name `authors` is also supported. The name `authors` is an alias of `author` and both can be used interchangeably.

!!!

=== author : `string`, `list`, or `object`

The author or multiple authors of this page.

```yml
---
author: Frank
---
```

```yml
---
author: frank@example.com
---
```

===

An author object can also be configured with specific values for the [`name`](#name), [`email`](#email), [`link`](#link), and [`avatar`](#avatar).

The `author` config is very flexible and can accept one or more author configurations and even a list of mixed types. The following sample demonstrates adding a list of authors. Two authors are added by name and a third is added only by their email address.

```yml
---
authors: [Frank, Annette Jones, steffen@example.com]
---
```

Mixed author types are also permitted, including adding a list of authors by name, email, or author configuration objects.

```yml
---
# Mix of author types
authors:
  - name: Frank Esposito
    email: frank@example.com
    link: https://twitter.com/frank
    avatar: https://example.com/frank.jpg
  - Annette Jones
  - steffen@example.com
---
```

### avatar

=== avatar : `string`

Possible options for the `avatar` include:

1. Path to local image
2. URL to an external image
3. Inline SVG
4. [Icon](/components/icon.md) shortcode
4. [Emoji](/components/emoji.md) shortcode

```yml
---
author:
  name: Frank Esposito
  avatar: https://example.com/frank.jpg # custom avatar takes precedence
---
```

===

### email

=== email : `string`

```yml
---
author:
  email: frank@example.com
---
```

===

### link

=== link : `string`

```yml
---
author:
  link: https://twitter.com/frank # custom link take precedence
---
```

===

### name

=== name : `string`

```yml
---
author:
  name: Frank Esposito
---
```

===

---

## category

!!!

The configuration name `categories` is also supported. The name `categories` is an alias of `category` and both can be used interchangeably.

!!!

=== category : `string` or `list`

A category for this page.

A single `category` or a list of `categories` can be configured in each `.md` page you would like to categorize.

The `category` is meant to be a broad grouping of content, where [`tags`](#tags) are meant to describe specific details of the content in that particular page. A page can belong to multiple (zero to many) categories and have multiple (zero to many) tags.

All of the following are acceptable techniques for configuring a single `category` or multiple `categories`.

```yml
---
category: news
categories: news
category: [news, general]
categories: [news, general]
category:
  - news
  - general
categories:
  - news
  - general
---
```

If a `category` is configured in the page metadata, the category is added to the top of the page under the main title.

Individual category summary pages will be automatically generated by Retype at `<url>/categories/<category>`, plus an additional `<url>/categories` index page which lists all categories in the project.

===

---

## date

=== date : `string`

A custom publish date for this page.

If a `date` is configured, Retype will add the **Published** date to the top of the page, just under the main title.

The date must be provided in the `yyyy-mm-dd` ISO format or `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm` if you want to include a date and a time.

```yml
date: 2020-11-25 # November 25, 2020
date: 2020-11-25T15:30 # November 25, 2020 at 15:30 (3:30 PM)
```

The `date` is used by Retype to order blog pages. Newer blog pages are ordered first.

===

---

## description

=== description : `string`

A custom description of the current page.

```yml
description: This is a custom description for this page
```
===

---

## expanded

=== expanded : `boolean`

Determines whether this [folder](folder.md) should be expanded in the tree navigation on initial page load. Default is `false`.

Set to `true` to expand the folder node in the navigation.

```yml
expanded: true
```

The `expanded` option only applies to [folders](folder.md) when configured within an `index.yml` folder configuration file.

Setting `expanded: true` within the metadata of an `.md` page or the paired `.yml` file will be ignored.
===

---

## icon

=== icon : `string`

Custom icon for the navigation node of the current page. Default is `null`.

Options include using an [Octicon](https://primer.github.io/octicons/) name, [Emoji](https://mojee.io/emojis/) shortcode, `<svg>` element, or a path to an image file.

```yml Octicon
icon: rocket
```

```yml Emoji shortcode
icon: ":rocket:"
```

```yml SVG element
icon: "<svg>...</svg>"
```

```yml Path
icon: "../static/rocket.png"
```
===

---

## image

=== image : `string`

By default, Retype will try to find the first image on the page and use that image as the feature image to highlight when creating a summary of the page.

You can customize the feature image by setting the `image` config to any local path or external image hosted elsewhere.

### Local path

Configure a path to a local file stored within the project.

```yml
image: ../static/feature-image1.jpg
```

### External image

Configure a URL to any image hosted elsewhere.

```yml
image: https://example.com/static/feature-image1.jpg
```

===

---

## label

=== label : `string`

Custom label for the navigation node for the current page. Default is `null`.

```yml
label: Custom label
```
===

---

## layout

=== layout : `string`

The layout for the page. Default is `default`.

Supported values: `default`, `central`, `page`, and `blog`.

Layout | Description
--- | ---
`default` | The default layout for all `.md` pages. The page is added to the main navigation.
`page` | Similar to `default` layout, but is not added to the main navigation.
`central` | A page with no left or right sidebar columns.
`blog` | A blog page layout. Blog pages are not added to the main navigation and include blog specific `< Newer` and `Older >` navigation buttons at the bottom of each blog page.

```yml
layout: page
```
===

---

## order

=== order : `string`

A custom stack order for this page within the left side-bar tree navigation.

Options can include:

- [x] A number such as `100` or `-100`
- [x] Any string value that will be slotted into the `A -> Z` alpha ordering of all navigation nodes
- [x] A [SemVer](https://semver.org/) value such as `v2.0`

If the `order` is set with a number, a larger positive number will give more _weight_ or _priority_ to that page and Retype will _bubble up_ that page in the navigation. For instance, a page configured with `order: 100` will be higher in the navigation than a page configured with `order: 10`.

Similarily, a page configured with `order: -100` will be lower in the navigation than a page configured with `order: -10` or any page where no `order` is set.

!!!

The position of folders within the navigation can be [ordered](folder.md) as well using the same `order` technique, the only difference that folders are always pinned to the top of their `order` group.

!!!

In order of precedence, the `order` of a page in the navigation would be determined with the following priority:

Value type | Description
--- | ---
`number` (positive) | A larger positive number gets more _weight_ or _priority_ and is pushed higher in the navigation. Largest number at the top. Example: `order: 100` will be ordered above `order: 10`.
`alpha` (high) | Setting `order` with an alpha-numeric value is possible and those pages will be ordered against the `label` value of all other pages that do not have an `order` configured.  Example: `order: alpha` will be ordered above `order: beta` or a page configured with `label: bravo`.
no `order` set | If no `order` is configured, all pages will be ordered alphabetically based on its `label`, `title`, the first `h1` title, or the file name values. The `label` config has the highest priorty.
`alpha` (low) | Example: `order: zulu` will be ordered below `order: zebra` or a page configured with `label: yakee`.
`vSemver` (newer) | Page `order` configured with a [semver](https://semver.org/) value are ordered with the newest version above an older version. These pages are also moved towards the bottom of the navigation. Example: `order: v1.1` will be ordered above `order: v1.0`.
`number` (negative) | A negative number gets less _weight_ or _priority_ and is pushed to the bottom of the navigation. Setting the `order` with a negative number is a simple way to push a page to the bottom ofthe navigation. Example: `order: -100` will be ordered below `order: -10`.

By default, the home page of the website has an order of `10000`. To add a page in the navigation just above the home page, set a value of `order: 10001` or greater. To add a page in the navigation just below the home page, set a value of `order: 9999` or lower. To move the home page to the bottom of the navigation, set a negative value, such as `order: -10000`.

### Order by number

Larger number = order higher in the stack.

No order number or `0` = order by alpha

Smaller number = order lower in the stack.

If multiple pages have the same `order` number, secondary ordering in that cluster is by alpha.

```
+
0
-
```

### Order by alpha

Order values by alpha.

`a` = higher
`z` = lower

```
Alpha
Bravo
Charlie
Zulu
```

### Order by `v{semver}`

Order by [semver](https://semver.org/) with latest release at the top

```
v5.0.1
v5
v4.0
v3.1
v3.0
v2.0
v1.0
```

Items prefixed with `v` would be grouped below the alpha ordered items.

```
alpha
bravo
yankee
zulu
v3.0
v2.1-beta
v2.0
v1.0
v1.0-beta
v1.0-alpha
```

## redirect

=== redirect : `string`

Redirect requests for this page to another location.

The `redirect` can be set to another page within this project, or an external link.

For example, you have an existing `setup.md` page and you want to move the content to `getting-started.md`, but other websites might still be linking to your old `example.com/setup/` page and you want to ensure those links still work. You would then set the following `redirect` page config in `setup.md` to redirect to `getting-started.md`.

```yml
---
redirect: getting-started.md
---

# Setup
```

Retype will automaticially handle any incoming `example.com/setup` requests and redirect to the new `example.com/getting-started` location.

Retype is also smart enough to scan your project for any `setup.md` links and replace those with a link directly to `getting-started.md`.

===

---

## route

=== route : `string`

A custom URL path for this page or folder which overrides the default path generated by Retype.

```md sample.md
---
route: /custom/path
---
# My page title

Some content here.
```

A custom `route` allows the folder and file structure to remain unchanged, but allowing the final URL's to be customized.

Configuring the `route` is an excellent solution when moving to Retype from another solution and you would like to maintain existing public URL's, but would prefer to re-organize your `.md` content files into a new structure. A custom `route` allows for a clean disconnect of the page path from the final published URL path.

In the following sample, the generated URL by Retype would be `/guide/2021-06-25-publishing-to-github-pages/`, but we override with a custom route which will publish the page to `/tutorial/publish-to-github-pages/`.

```md /guide/2021-06-25-publishing-to-github-pages.md
---
route: /tutorial/publish-to-github-pages/
---
# Publishing to GitHub Pages
```

If a custom `route` is configured on a folder, or on a `readme.md` or `index.md` page within the folder, or on an [`index.yml`](#separate-yml-file) file within the folder, that custom route is assumed to be the base route for all pages within that folder.

The following scenario demonstrates a basic scenario where we want to configure the pages within the `/guides/` folder to be served from the custom URL location of `/tutorials/`.

To accomplish this goal, configure the `route` on the `readme.md`, then all other pages within the same folder will adjust as well. The `configuration.md` page will now be served from `/tutorials/configuration/`.

``` Folder structure
|-- /guides
    |-- readme.md
    |-- configuration.md
```

```md /guides/readme.md
---
route: /tutorials
---
# Tutorials
```

File path | Old URL | New URL
-- | -- | --
`/guides/readme.md` | `/guides` | `/tutorials`
`/guides/configuration.md` | `/guides/configuration` | `/tutorials/configuration`
===

---

## tags

=== tags : `list`

A list of tags can be added to the metadata at the top of each `.md` page you would like to tag.

The `tags` are meant to describe specific details of the content in that page. Tags are similar to [`category`](#category), although `category` is meant to describe be a broad grouping of content. A page can belong to multiple (zero to many) categories and have multiple (zero to many) tags.


If tags are configured in the page metadata, a list of tag links are added to the bottom of the page. See the bottom of this page for a working sample.

Individual tag summary pages will be automatically generated by Retype at [`<url>/tags/<tag>`](/tags/guide/), plus an additional [`<url>/tags`](/tags/) index page which lists all tags and their count used within the project.

!!!

Check out the pages of this website configured with the [!badge variant="info" text="guide"](/tags/guide/) tag.

!!!

``` Sample tags configuration
---
tags: [guide]
---
# Page title

Some content here.
```

Multiple tags can be added to the list by separating each with a comma `,`.

``` Sample list of tags
---
tags: [guide, config options, installation]
---
# Page title

Some content here.
```

A list style syntax is also supported for `tags`:

``` Sample tags list
---
tags:
  - guide
  - config options
  - installation
---
```

===

---

## templating

=== templating: `boolean`

Templating can be disabled on a per-page basis by setting `templating: false` in the page metadata.

```md
---
templating: false
---
```

===

---

## title

=== title : `string`

The `title` config instructs Retype to add a primary `# Page Title` to your page, but it is recommended to manually add a `# Page Title` to each of your pages, instead of setting a `title`.

As a general rule, the actual content of your page should not be configured in the page metadata.

!!!
The `title` is primarily used to support backwards compatibiity with the `.md` content style from other older legacy static site generator applications.
!!!

The following sample demonstrates setting the `title` config instead of explicitly using a `# Page Title` to your page.

```
---
title: Getting Started
---
Some content here.
```

Try to avoid using the `title` config. Please add a real page `# Page Title` to your document. The `# Page Title` will be rendered in HTML as `<h1>Page Title</h1>`.

For example, the sample above should ideally be written as the following instead of using a `title` config.

```
# Getting Started

Some content here.
```

===

---

## visibility

=== visibility : `public|hidden`

Configure the visibility of the page to be `hidden` or `public`. Default is `public`.

If a page is configued to be `visibility: hidden`, the page is still created but will not be included in the page navigation or search results.

The following sample demonstrates hidding a page:

```md
---
visibility: hidden
---
# A hidden page

This page will be hidden from the menu and search results.
```

The page will still be created and added to the final website, but it is _hidden_. You can still link to the page or share a link to the page. Retype would ensure no _generated_ links or references to the hidden page are created. If on a public page, a link to a hidden page is made, the link will work and the hidden page will be visible.

The History :icon-history: component will continue to function as normal. Any hidden page visited would still be logged in the history, although that history is only available to the visitor.

Setting `visibility: hidden` on a page is a good way to create a _draft_ or _secret_ page that you do not want included in the navigation, but you still want to share a link to the page for others to view if they have the link.

Retype does not show you the link to this page, but it uses the same naming convention as all other pages is used. For instance, if your site is hosted at `https://example.com` and the page was called `my-secret-page.md`, the URL would be `https://example.com/my-secret-page/`.
