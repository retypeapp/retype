## Can I test Retype Pro features?

Yes. Use the command `retype start --pro` to start your project instead of `retype start`.

Or, add the following `pro: true` config to your project `retype.yml` file:

```yaml
start:
  pro: true
```

The [`poweredByRetype`](/configuration/project.md#poweredbyretype) branding will still be enabled and the 100 page limit will remain in place, but all other Retype Pro features will be available for testing.

## Please summarize how the licensing works?

- [x] Retype is free to use for both commercial and open-source projects
- [x] Retype Pro and Enterprise include extra functionality
- [x] Retype Pro and Retype Enterprise require a key
- [x] All keys include free version upgrades
- [x] After purchasing, your key will be emailed to you
- [x] See table below for details:

{.compact}
License | Key required | Price | Free upgrades | Renewal | Pro&nbsp;projects<br>^* per domain^ | Max&nbsp;Pages<br>^* per project^
-- | :--: | -- | -- | -- | :--: | :--:
Free | No | Free | Free | $0 | 0 | 100
Pro | Yes | $149 | 3 years | $99 | 1 | Unlimited
Enterprise | Yes | $749 | 3 years | $549 | Unlimited ^[*](#what-is-a-project)^ | Unlimited

!!!
As your key end date approaches, we will send you a reminder email to renew. Renewal is optional and your project will continue to work even if your key is not [renewed](#what-happens-when-the-key-expires).
!!!

## If I do not renew, does my website stop working?

If you do not renew your Pro or Enterprise license, your project will continue to work as it has always worked. Everything will continue to function as normal and without interruption. Even adding more pages to your project would continue to work.

The only thing that changes is that you would not be able to upgrade your project to the next Retype release.

Once your website is built it will continue to work, even if your Pro or Enterprise license is not renewed.

You can [purchase](/pro/pro.md) a new license at any point in the future.

## Is Retype Pro a separate product?

No. A Retype Key will unlock functionality within the same `retypeapp` that you have already [installed](/guides/getting-started.md). A separate installer or product installation is not required.

Adding the key to your [wallet](/guides/cli.md#retype-wallet) will automatically unlock all Pro features.

## What is a Project?

Each **retype.yml** file used by Retype to generate a website is considered a Project.

Each project requires the [`url`](/configuration/project.md#url) setting to be added to your project **retype.yml** file.

With your purchase of a Pro or Enterprise license, a key is generated and will be registered to your `url`.

The `url` can be a domain name or subdomain name.

With Retype Pro, a key is registered to one domain name or subdomain name, for instance, `example.com` or `docs.example.com`.

With Retype Enterprise, a key is registered to one domain name and AND all subdomains of the domain, for instance, `example.com` and `*.example.com`.

| License | Websites | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pro | One domain name **OR** one subdomain name | `example.com` **OR** `docs.example.com`
| Enterprise | One domain name **AND** all subdomain names | `example.com` **AND** `*.example.com`

Each subdomain name counts as one unique URL, except the `www` subdomain. Both `example.com` and `www.example.com` are treated as one URL by Retype.

The `url` is included inside the key. You can have any number of instances of the project running on any number of developer machines or servers using the same key, but the key will be limited to building only those projects with a **retype.yml** file where the [`url`](/configuration/project.md#url) is set with the same URL defined in your key.

## What if I have more than one Pro project?

Please purchase one license for each Retype Pro project you require.

Retype Pro licenses can be purchased in any quantity. You can purchase one now and additional licenses at a future time.

Each license is created and managed separately.

Retype Enterprise licenses can be purchased to unlock an entire domain name and all subdomain names. Perfect for an organization that has multiple projects and requires the flexibility to publish to any subdomain.

## What if I need to change the location and URL of my project?

No problem. Within the first 15 days, one change to a different extension or subdomain can be made to a Retype Pro license. Just send a quick email to hello@retype.com with the request.

For instance, changing from `example.org` to `example.com` or `example.org` to `docs.example.com` are permitted. Changing from `example.com` to `sample.com` would not be permitted.

This flexibiity gives you lots of time to create your project then decide what domain name or subdomain name you want to go live with.

After 15 days, we cannot change the URL associated to your key and purchasing a new key would be required.

We are currently building a dashboard system to allow self management of keys and will let you know once available.

!!!
The Retype keys are non-revocable, meaning once they are created, there is no way for us or anyone to cancel or revoke the key.
!!!

## We have 5 people on our team, do we require 5 licenses?

No. Retype is licensed per [project](#what-is-a-project) (website), not per person or per server.

One license for your project will cover an unlimited number of users, authors, and developers using Retype on that project.

## What happens when the key expires?

If you do not renew for another term, your project stays on the last release available as of your key end date. You would not be able to upgrade your project to the next release of Retype.

Let's run through two scenarios based on purchasing Retype Pro today using the following details:

- You purchase today
- Current release is Retype `v{{ version }}`
- Key expires three years from today
- On your key end date, let's say Retype `v5.5.0` is the current release

###  Scenario 1: Renew

You like Retype, it is bringing you value and happiness :smiling_face_with_3_hearts:, and you want to renew. After purchasing a renewal, you will get another unique key with a new expiry date. Add that new key to your project and your project is now unlocked until that key expires. All upgrades are included while the key is valid.

###  Scenario 2: No renew

You decide NOT to renew your Retype key :cry:. No worries. Your project will continue to build forever, except you cannot upgrade the project to the next Retype release. You would stay on your current release.

You would be able to upgrade Retype up until `v5.0`.

Installing Retype `v5.1` would be possible, but your project would fail to build. You would need to downgrade back to `v5.0` or renew your Retype key, or remove the key from your project and use the free version of Retype.

You would still be able to build up to 1000 pages and remove the **Powered by Retype** branding, but only if using the release at the time your key expired. Again, you just would not be able to upgrade to any future releases.

If at some point in the future you would like to upgrade to the latest release, just [purchase](/pro/pro.md) a new Retype Pro key at that time.

The renewal fee is 50% of the original purchase price. For pricing, see table [above](#please-summarize-how-the-licensing-works).

## Can I purchase two licenses and save one for future use?

Yes. The key end date will be 3 years (36 months) from the date the key is created.

You could use one key now and save the other for a future project or to renew the original project.

## We have other license requirements, are there other options?

Yes, custom licensing options are available. Please send an email to hello@retype.com with your requirements.
