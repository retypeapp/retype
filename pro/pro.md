## Can I test Retype Pro features?

Yes. Use the command `retype start --pro` to start your project instead of `retype start`.

Or, add the following `pro: true` config to your project `retype.yml` file:

```yml
start:
  pro: true
```

The [`poweredByRetype`](/configuration/project.md#poweredbyretype) branding will still be enabled and the 100 page limit will remain in place, but all other Retype Pro features will be available for testing.

## Please summarize how the licensing works?

- [x] Retype is free to use for both commercial and open-source projects
- [x] Retype Pro and Enterprise include extra functionality
- [x] Retype Pro and Retype Enterprise require a license key
- [x] All license keys include free version upgrades
- [x] After purchasing, your license key will be emailed to you
- [x] See table below for details:

{.compact}
License | Key required | Price | Free upgrades | Renewal | Pro projects<br>^* per domain name^ | Max Pages<br>^* per project^
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
Free | No | Free | Free | $0 | 0 | 100
Pro | Yes | $99 | 3 years | $49 | 1 | 1000
Pro+ | Yes | $199 | 3 years | $99 | 1 | Unlimited
Enterprise | Yes | $499 | 3 years | $249 | Unlimited ^[*](#what-is-a-project)^ | 1000
Enterprise+ | Yes | $999 | 3 years | $499 | Unlimited ^[*](#what-is-a-project)^ | Unlimited

!!!
As your license key end date approaches, we will send you a reminder email to renew. Renewal is optional and your project will continue to work even if your license key is not [renewed](#what-happens-when-the-key-expires).
!!!

## If I do not renew, does my website stop working?

If you do not renew your Pro or Enterprise license, your project will continue to work as it has always worked. Everything will continue to function as normal and without interruption. Even adding more pages to your project would continue to work.

The only thing that changes is that you would not be able to upgrade your project to the next Retype release.

Once your website is built it will continue to work, even if your Pro or Enterprise license is not renewed.

You can [purchase](/pro/pro.md) a new license at any point in the future.

## Is Retype Pro a separate product?

No. A Retype Pro license key will unlock functionality within the same `retypeapp` that you have already [installed](/guides/getting-started.md). A separate installer or product installation is not required.

Adding the license key to your [wallet](/guides/cli.md#retype-wallet) will automatically unlock all Pro features.

## What is a Project?

Each **retype.yml** file used by Retype to generate a website is considered a Project.

Each project requires the [`url`](/configuration/project.md#url) config be set in your project **retype.yml** file.

With your purchase of a Pro or Enterprise license, a license key is generated and will be registered to your `url`.

The `url` can be a domain name or subdomain name.

With Retype Pro, a license key is registered to one domain name or subdomain name, for instance, `example.com` or `docs.example.com`.

With Retype Enterprise, a license key is registered to one domain name and AND all subdomains of the domain, for instance, `example.com` and `*.example.com`.

| License | Websites | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pro or Pro+ | One domain name **OR** one subdomain name | `example.com` **OR** `docs.example.com`
| Enterprise or Enterprise+ | One domain name **AND** all subdomain names | `example.com` **AND** `*.example.com`

Each subdomain name counts as one unique URL, except the `www` subdomain. Both `example.com` and `www.example.com` are treated as one URL by Retype.

The `url` is included inside the license key. You can have any number of instances of the project running on any number of developer machines or servers using the same key, but the key will be limited to building only those projects with a **retype.yml** file where the [`url`](/configuration/project.md#url) is set with the same URL defined in your license key.

## What if I have more than one Pro project?

Please purchase one license for each Retype Pro project you require.

Retype Pro licenses can be purchased in any quantity. You can purchase one now and additional licenses at a future time.

Each license is created and managed separately.

Retype Enterprise licenses can be purchased to unlock an entire domain name and all subdomain names. Perfect for an organization that has multiple projects and requires the flexibility to publish to any subdomain.

## What if I need to change the location and URL of my project?

No problem. Within the first 30 days, one change to a different extension or subdomain can be made to a Retype Pro license. Just send a quick email to hello@retype.com with the request.

For instance, changing from `example.org` to `example.com` or `example.org` to `docs.example.com` are permitted. Changing from `example.com` to `sample.com` would not be permitted.

This flexibiity gives you lots of time to create your project then decide what domain name or subdomain name you want to go live with.

After 30 days, we cannot change the URL associated to your license key and purchasing a new key would be required.

We are currently building a dashboard system to allow self management of license keys and will let you know once available.

!!!
The Retype license keys are non-revocable, meaning once they are created, there is no way for us or anyone to cancel or revoke the key.
!!!

## We have 5 people on our team, do we require 5 licenses?

No. Retype is licensed per [project](#what-is-a-project) (website), not per person or per server.

One license for your project will cover an unlimited number of users, authors, and developers using Retype on that project.

## What happens when the key expires?

If you do not renew for another term, your project stays on the last release available as of your license key end date. You would not be able to upgrade your project to the next release of Retype.

Let's run through two scenarios based on purchasing Retype Pro today using the following details:

- You purchase today
- Current release is Retype `v3.5`
- Key expires three years from today
- On your license key end date, let's say Retype `v5.0` is the current release

###  Scenario 1: Renew

You like Retype, it is bringing you value and happiness :smiling_face_with_3_hearts:, and you want to renew. After purchasing a renewal, you will get another unique license key with a new expiry date. Add that new key to your project and your project is now unlocked until that key expires. All upgrades are included while the key is valid.

###  Scenario 2: No renew

You decide NOT to renew your Retype key :cry:. No worries. Your project will continue to build forever, except you cannot upgrade the project to the next Retype release. You would stay on the current release.

You would be able to upgrade Retype up until `v5.0`.

Installing Retype `v5.1` would be possible, but your project would fail to build. You would have to downgrade back to `v5.0` or renew your Retype Pro license.

You would still be able to build up to 1000 pages and remove the **Powered by Retype** branding, but only if using the release at the time your key expired. Again, you just would not be able to upgrade to any future releases.

If at some point in the future you would like to upgrade to the latest release, just [purchase](/pro/pro.md) a new Retype Pro key at that time.

The renewal fee is 50% of the original purchase price. For pricing, see table [above](#please-summarize-how-the-licensing-works).

## Can I purchase two licenses and save one for future use?

Yes. The license key end date will be 3 years (36 months) from the date the license key is created.

You could use one key now and save the other for a future project or to renew the original project.

## We have other license requirements, are there other options?

Yes, the Retype licensing is very flexible and custom licensing is possible. Please send an email to hello@retype.com with your requirements.
