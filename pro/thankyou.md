## I need more assistance

How about a free 30 minute one-on-one video consultation session?

If yes, send an [email](mailto:hello@retype.com) or start a chat :icon-comment:, and let's coordinate a time to meet.

Use the time for:

- Troubleshooting
- Get answers to your Retype questions
- Advice to optimize your project
- Provide product feedback
- Make feature requests

Video consulations can be done through your choice of video conferencing software, such as Zoom, Google Meet, Slack, FaceTime, TeamViewer, GoTo Meeting, or pretty much anything else if you have specific requirements.

Ideally, your project would be available in a GitHub or GitLab repository for us to review as we will likely be reviewing code and offering configuration suggestions.
