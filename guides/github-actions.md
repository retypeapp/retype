# GitHub Actions

Add a simple GitHub Action to your project to automate the building and deployment of your Retype powered website.

Currently, there are two Retype related GitHub Actions:

1. Retype [Build Action](https://github.com/retypeapp/action-build)
2. Retype [GitHub Pages Action](https://github.com/retypeapp/action-github-pages)

The first, **Build Action** will automatically build your Retype powered website with each new change that is committed.

The second, **GitHub Pages Action** will automatically publish your newly built website to a branch in Github so it is available to host from [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). By default, the `retype` branch is used, but of course that is also configurable, it can also be used to deploy to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and a lot of other pages!

Automatically deploying to GitHub Pages requires a basic **retype-action.yml** configuration file to be added to your GitHub repo and some simple project configuration.

!!!
Content `write` permission are required so that Retype and can automatically create the `retype` branch and write the generated files into that branch.

## Summary

- [x] Add a **retype-action.yml** file, see [step 1](#step-1-add-retype-actionyml-workflow)
- [x] Configure GitHub Pages, see [step 2](/hosting/github-pages.md#step-2-configure-github-pages)
- [x] Set the branch to `retype`, see [branch config](/hosting/github-pages.md#pick-a-branch)
- [x] Set the [`url`](/hosting/github-pages.md#set-a-url)
- [x] More details on the Retype [Build Action](https://github.com/retypeapp/action-build).
- [x] More details on the Retype [GitHub Pages Action](https://github.com/retypeapp/action-github-pages).

All of these options are configurable and your specific requirements may vary. There is a lot of flexibility. Please check out the [Project Configuration](/configuration/project.md) options for full details.

## Step 1: Add **retype-action.yml** workflow

Add the following **retype-action.yml** file to your GitHub project within the `.github/workflows/` folder.

If the `.github/workflows/` folders do not exist within the root of your project, you can manually create the folders and they will be committed along with the **retype-action.yml**.

```yml .github/workflows/retype-action.yml
name: Publish Retype powered website to GitHub Pages
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: retypeapp/action-build@latest

      - uses: retypeapp/action-github-pages@latest
        with:
          update-branch: true
```

The above **retype-action.yml** workflow configuration instructs GitHub Actions to automatically build your website upon each commit to the `main` branch, and then deploy your new Retype powered website to a `retype` branch.

If the `retype` branch is not available, the GitHub Action will automatically create the branch.

If the default branch in your repo is `master`, change `- main` to `- master`. If the docs project was within a `docs` branch, change `- main` to `- docs`. The following snippet demonstrates setting the branch to `master`.

```yml
  push:
    branches:
      - master
```

Commit your **.github/workflows/retype-action.yml** file and push to your repo.

### RETYPE_SECRET

If your project requires a Retype license key, that key can be configured by adding a [`RETYPE_SECRET`](../configuration/envvars.md/#retype_secret) secret to your repository settings and the corresponding `env` configuration to your project **.github/workflows/retype-action.yml** file.

{%{
```yml
- uses: retypeapp/action-build@latest
  env:
    RETYPE_SECRET: ${{ secrets.RETYPE_SECRET }}
```
}%}

The following demonstrates a basic template to use for a workflow configuration file, if including the license key:

```yml .github/workflows/retype-action.yml
name: Publish Retype powered website to GitHub Pages
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  publish:
    name: Publish to retype branch

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      contents: write

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: retypeapp/action-build@latest
        env:
          RETYPE_SECRET: {%{${{ secrets.RETYPE_SECRET }}}%}
          RETYPE_PASSWORD: {%{${{ secrets.RETYPE_PASSWORD }}}%}

      - uses: retypeapp/action-github-pages@latest
        with:
          update-branch: true
```

### RETYPE_PASSWORD

If your project uses either [`protected`](/configuration/page.md#protected) or [`private`](/configuration/page.md#private) pages, adding a password for your visitors to use is required.

{{ include "snippets/password-notice.md" }}

A password can be configured by adding a [`RETYPE_PASSWORD`](../configuration/envvars.md/#retype_password) secret to your repository settings and the following `env` configuration to your project **.github/workflows/retype-action.yml** file.

{%{
```yml
- uses: retypeapp/action-build@latest
  env:
    RETYPE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.RETYPE_PASSWORD }}
```
}%}

If both the `RETYPE_SECRET` and `RETYPE_PASSWORD` are needed, the configuration should be the following:

{%{
```yml
- uses: retypeapp/action-build@latest
  env:
    RETYPE_SECRET: ${{ secrets.RETYPE_SECRET }}
    RETYPE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.RETYPE_PASSWORD }}
```
}%}

## Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages

Once [Step 1](#step-1-add-retype-actionyml-workflow) is complete, now configure your [GitHub Pages](/hosting/github-pages.md) web site hosting.
