# Web server

Retype can be hosted on any web server that allows you to host static website files such as `.html`, `.js`, `.css`, and images. That pretty much includes 100% of the website hosting solutions available, including all shared hosting services.

FTP the contents of the [`output`](/configuration/project.md#output) folder to your web server. By default, the `output` location should be the `.retype` folder within in the root of your project.

From Retype's perspective, no other configuration is required. Your entire Retype generated website is self contained. No special server-side technologies are required. Just the ability to host static website files.
