# GitHub Pages

Hosting your Retype built website on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is free and simple to setup.

## Step 1: Add **retype-action.yml** workflow

We first recommend adding the Retype [Build Action](/guides/github-actions.md) to your project to automate the building and deployment of your Retype powered website.

## Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages

With some simple configuration, GitHub can host your website for free.

To get started, navigate to the **Settings** > **Pages** page of your repo. The URL should be the following, although you will need to replace `<organization>` and `<repo>` with your values:

```
https://github.com/<organization>/<repo>/settings/pages
```

### Pick a branch

By default, the Retype Action will publish your website to a `retype` branch, although you can configure to host from any branch.

If you have committed the **retype-action.yml** file as detailed in [Step 1](#step-1-add-retype-actionyml-workflow), you should now have a `retype` branch available within the list. Select `retype` then click the **Save** button.

Your GitHub Pages configuration should now look similar to the following:

!!! Enforce HTTPS
We recommend that you check the **Enforce HTTPS** checkbox.

### Set a `url`

With the above sample, GitHub will provide a unique `github.io` subdomain to host your website from.

Your website will be available from a subfolder of that subdomain. In our scenario, our website will be available in the `/retype/` subfolder.

For example, the URL will use the following pattern:

```
https://<organization>.github.io/<repo>/
```

You would then set the [`url`](/configuration/project.md#url) configuration with the following, where `<organization>` is replaced with your GitHub organization name and `<repo>` is replaced with your repository name.

```yml
url: <organization>.github.io/<repo>/
```

If your GitHub organization name was `CompanyX` and your repo name was `Docs`, your `url` configuration would be:

```yml
url: companyx.github.io/docs/
```

### Custom domain

Instead of using the `github.io` domain, it is possible to configure GitHub Pages to use a custom domain name or subdomain name.

Just enter your domain name or subdomain name in the **Custom domain** field and click **Save**.

If your website will be available at `https://example.com`, use `example.com` as the **Custom domain** value.

If your website will be available at `https://docs.example.com`, use `docs.example.com`.

You will then need to [configure the DNS](https://docs.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) for your domain name.

The last step would be updating the [`url`](/configuration/project.md#url) project configuration with the same value. For example, if your website will be available at `https://example.com`, use the following `url` configuration:

```yml
url: example.com
```
