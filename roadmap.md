../components/default.md
```

Block-level Markdown components will be ignored for those configs.

!!!warning

This release failed to run properly if the NPM package was installed. üßê We didn't notice that our NPM Access Token had expired between the `v1.8.0` and `v1.8.1` releases. The expired NPM token caused our automated release process to fail. Sorry about that. :weary: Once we figured out what was going wrong, a new NPM Access Token was set and [`v1.8.2`](https://github.com/retypeapp/retype/releases/tag/v1.8.2) was released. We have added NPM token pre-checks and verifications to the automated release process to hopefully prevent the issue from ever happening again.
